Below is a **feature catalog** of Python’s `intervaltree` library, clustered into semantically coherent sections and written in the same “surface area + power knobs + footguns” style as your PyArrow reference. 

---

# 0) Mental model (what the library *is*)

`intervaltree` provides:

* `Interval(begin, end, data)` objects representing **half-open intervals** **[begin, end)** (lower bound included, upper bound excluded). It is explicitly designed for “tagging text and time intervals” with string-slice semantics; **0-length intervals are null** and overlap nothing, so `end` must be strictly greater than `begin`. ([GitHub][1])
* `IntervalTree`: a **mutable, self-balancing** interval tree supporting point queries, overlap queries, and envelopment (“contained-by”) queries. The project also calls out **automatic AVL balancing**. ([GitHub][1])
* Query results are **sets of `Interval`**; if you need deterministic ordering, you sort them (typical pattern: `sorted(tree[point])`). ([GitHub][1])

---

# 1) Core objects and “data model” surface

## 1.1 `Interval(begin, end, data=None)` (record + payload)

**Primary fields / tuple behavior**

* `iv.begin`, `iv.end`, `iv.data` are the public data plane. ([GitHub][1])
* `begin, end, data = iv` tuple-unpacks. ([GitHub][1])

**Ordering semantics (affects sorting + some merge patterns)**

* Intervals are ordered by `begin`, then `end`, then `data`; if `data` is not orderable, it falls back to sorting by `type(data)`. (This matters if you do `sorted(tree)` or `sorted(tree[...])` and want deterministic results.) ([GitHub][2])

---

# 2) Construction / initialization

## 2.1 Build an `IntervalTree`

* Empty: `tree = IntervalTree()` ([GitHub][1])
* From an iterable of `Interval`: `tree = IntervalTree(intervals)` ([GitHub][1])
* From tuples: `IntervalTree.from_tuples([(begin, end), ...])` (tuples may omit `data` if you don’t need payloads). ([GitHub][1])

---

# 3) Insertions and bulk updates

## 3.1 Add intervals (single)

* Slice assignment: `tree[begin:end] = data` (idiomatic; matches the half-open semantics). ([GitHub][1])
* Explicit: `tree.add(interval)` ([GitHub][1])
* Convenience: `tree.addi(begin, end, data)` ([GitHub][1])

## 3.2 Bulk add

* `tree.update(iterable)` (this is the preferred bulk method; `extend(...)` was removed in v3 in favor of `update`). ([GitHub][1])
* Operator forms: `tree |= other_tree` (union-update). ([GitHub][1])

---

# 4) Deletions and range removal

## 4.1 Remove exact intervals

* `tree.remove(interval)` → raises `ValueError` if missing ([GitHub][1])
* `tree.discard(interval)` → no-op if missing ([GitHub][1])
* Shorthands:

  * `tree.removei(begin, end, data)`
  * `tree.discardi(begin, end, data)` ([GitHub][1])

## 4.2 Remove by overlap/envelopment

* `tree.remove_overlap(point)`
* `tree.remove_overlap(begin, end)` (removes all intervals overlapping the query range) ([GitHub][1])
* `tree.remove_envelop(begin, end)` (removes all intervals **fully contained** in the query range) ([GitHub][1])

## 4.3 Delete syntax sugar

* `del tree[point]` is documented as equivalent to `tree.remove_overlap(point)` in examples. ([GitHub][1])
* `tree.clear()` empties the tree. ([GitHub][1])

---

# 5) Query surface (the “read path” APIs)

## 5.1 Version note (important API drift)

* v3 removed `search(begin, end, strict)`; use:

  * `at(point)`
  * `overlap(begin, end)`
  * `envelop(begin, end)` ([GitHub][1])

## 5.2 Point queries (“what covers this coordinate?”)

* `tree[point]` → set of intervals containing `point` ([GitHub][1])
* `tree.at(point)` → same semantics ([GitHub][1])

## 5.3 Range overlap queries (“what intersects this span?”)

* `tree[begin:end]` → set of intervals that overlap the query range ([GitHub][1])
* `tree.overlap(begin, end)` → same semantics ([GitHub][1])

**Half-open semantics are operationally critical**: queries are over `begin ≤ x < end`. Example: querying `[2,4)` returns none if you only have intervals `[1,2)` and `[4,7)` because neither includes points in `[2,4)`. ([GitHub][1])

## 5.4 Envelopment queries (“what is fully contained?”)

* `tree.envelop(begin, end)` → intervals completely enveloped by the query range (i.e., contained-by it). ([GitHub][1])

---

# 6) Membership + predicate helpers

* Exact membership: `interval_obj in tree` (explicitly called out as **fastest**, O(1)). ([GitHub][1])
* `tree.containsi(begin, end, data)` (membership helper for tuple form) ([GitHub][1])
* “Does anything overlap?”:

  * `tree.overlaps(point)`
  * `tree.overlaps(begin, end)` ([GitHub][1])

---

# 7) Iteration, sizing, and boundary introspection

## 7.1 Iteration forms

* `for interval in tree:` (tree is iterable) ([GitHub][1])
* `tree.items()` (explicit items access) ([GitHub][1])

## 7.2 Size / emptiness

* `len(tree)`, `tree.is_empty()`, and `not tree` are all supported idioms. ([GitHub][1])

## 7.3 Coordinate extents (useful for “span mapping” systems)

* `tree.begin()` → begin coordinate of the leftmost interval
* `tree.end()` → end coordinate of the rightmost interval ([GitHub][1])

---

# 8) Set algebra (IntervalTree as a set-like container)

`IntervalTree` supports classic set operations via both **methods** and **operators**: ([GitHub][1])

## 8.1 Union

* `tree.union(iterable)` and `tree1 | tree2`
* In-place: `tree.update(iterable)` and `tree |= other_tree`

## 8.2 Difference

* `tree.difference(iterable)` and `tree1 - tree2`
* In-place: `tree.difference_update(iterable)` and `tree -= other_tree`

## 8.3 Intersection

* `tree.intersection(iterable)` and `tree1 & tree2`
* In-place: `tree.intersection_update(iterable)` and `tree &= other_tree`

## 8.4 Symmetric difference

* `tree.symmetric_difference(iterable)` and `tree1 ^ tree2`
* In-place: `tree.symmetric_difference_update(iterable)` and `tree ^= other_tree`

## 8.5 Comparisons

* subset/superset + rich comparisons: `issubset`, `issuperset`, `<=`, `>=`, `==` ([GitHub][1])

---

# 9) Restructuring / normalization (the “span surgery” toolbox)

This is the part you’ll likely lean on for *span mapping* and *non-overlapping canonicalization*.

## 9.1 `chop(begin, end, datafunc=None)`

* “Slice intervals and remove everything between `begin` and `end`,” producing up to two residual intervals per affected interval. ([GitHub][1])
* Optional `datafunc(iv, islower)` lets you rewrite payloads depending on which side survives (lower/upper). Example shape is shown in docs. ([GitHub][1])

## 9.2 `slice(point, datafunc=None)`

* Splits intervals at a specific point **without removing** anything; again optional data rewriting is supported. ([GitHub][1])

## 9.3 `split_overlaps(...)`

* “Slice at all interval boundaries” to eliminate overlaps by segmenting (optionally modifying `data`). ([GitHub][1])

## 9.4 Merge operations (coalescing)

* `merge_overlaps(...)`: “joins overlapping intervals into a single interval,” optionally merging data fields; methods that take `strict` now default `strict=True`. ([GitHub][1])
* `merge_equals(...)`: “joins intervals with matching ranges,” optionally merging data. ([GitHub][1])
* `merge_neighbors(...)`: joins adjacent intervals when their endpoints are within a threshold distance; can optionally merge overlaps and merge data fields. ([GitHub][1])

---

# 10) Copying, conversion, and serialization

* `IntervalTree(tree)` constructs a new tree that references the **same** `Interval` objects (structural copy, not deep copy). ([GitHub][1])
* `tree.copy()` produces a tree whose `Interval` objects are *shallow copies*. ([GitHub][1])
* Convert to plain containers:

  * `set(tree)`
  * `list(tree)` (and either can later be fed into `IntervalTree(...)`). ([GitHub][1])
* “Pickle-friendly” is explicitly called out as a feature. ([GitHub][1])

---

# 11) Performance/robustness notes you should treat as “API contracts”

* **Half-open everywhere**: both stored intervals and query spans follow `[begin, end)` semantics; this is the most important correctness invariant for any span system. ([GitHub][1])
* **No null intervals**: zero-length intervals are treated as null and overlap nothing; many user errors are “end == begin.” ([GitHub][1])
* **Self-balancing claim**: the project explicitly frames itself as “self-balancing” and mentions **AVL** (useful when you assume asymptotics for large interval corpora). ([GitHub][1])
* General interval tree complexity expectations (not specific guarantees): overlap queries are typically **O(log n + m)** where `m` is number of reported intervals; insert/delete **O(log n)**. ([Wikipedia][3])

---

If you want the *next increment* (analogous to your PyArrow doc), I can convert each section above into a “deep dive” that includes: exact argument semantics for `strict`, the reducer hooks for `merge_*` (data merge strategy), and a “span mapping playbook” (byte offsets vs (line,col), canonicalization strategy with `split_overlaps()` → `merge_neighbors()`, and deterministic sorting/caching patterns).

[1]: https://github.com/chaimleib/intervaltree "GitHub - chaimleib/intervaltree: A mutable, self-balancing interval tree. Queries may be by point, by range overlap, or by range containment."
[2]: https://github.com/chaimleib/intervaltree/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com "intervaltree/CHANGELOG.md at master"
[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Interval tree"

Below is the “next increment” deep-dive (analogous to a PyArrow-style advanced note): **(A)** exact `strict` semantics, **(B)** the `merge_*` reducer hooks (data merge strategy, aliasing + determinism pitfalls), and **(C)** a **span-mapping playbook** (byte offsets vs `(line,col)`, `split_overlaps() → merge_neighbors()` canonicalization, deterministic sorting + caching).

I’m grounding signatures/behavior on **intervaltree tag `3.2.1`** (Dec 24, 2025)  and the upstream README for high-level invariants (half-open intervals, v3 “strict defaults True”). ([GitHub][1])

---

## A) `strict` semantics: what it *actually* gates (and what it doesn’t)

### A1) First invariant: everything is half-open `[begin, end)`

`intervaltree` is explicitly “string slice” semantics: intervals include the lower bound and exclude the upper bound; **0-length intervals are null** (so `end` must be strictly greater than `begin`). ([GitHub][1])
This matters because “touching” means `a.end == b.begin` and **there is no shared point**.

### A2) “strict” in v3: default is consistently `True`

Upstream notes that methods taking `strict` now default `strict=True` consistently (v3 cleanup). ([GitHub][1])

### A3) Where `strict` applies (3.2.1): merges, not queries

In **3.2.1**, `strict` shows up on:

* `merge_overlaps(..., strict=True)`
* `merge_neighbors(..., strict=True)`  (and verified by the 3.2.1 source signature)

It **does not** affect `at()`, `overlap()`, `envelop()`, or membership tests; those follow half-open semantics.

---

## A4) Exact semantics by method (3.2.1)

### `merge_overlaps(strict=True|False)`

Signature (3.2.1 source):
`merge_overlaps(self, data_reducer=None, data_initializer=None, strict=True)`

Operational condition (conceptually):

* Let `lower` be the last merged interval and `higher` be the next interval in sorted order.
* Overlap test: `higher.begin < lower.end`
* Touching adjacency: `higher.begin == lower.end`

Behavior:

* **strict=True (default):** merge only if **actual overlap** (`higher.begin < lower.end`). Adjacent touching intervals are *not* merged.
* **strict=False:** merge if overlap **or** adjacency (`higher.begin <= lower.end` in half-open terms).

This is exactly the “do we coalesce contiguous segments?” knob.

### `merge_neighbors(distance=1, strict=True|False)`

Signature (3.2.1 source):
`merge_neighbors(self, data_reducer=None, data_initializer=None, distance=1, strict=True)`

This is “merge by gap threshold,” implemented via arithmetic:

* `margin = higher.begin - lower.end`

Implications:

* Bounds must support subtraction (practically: **ints/floats**). If you store `(line, col)` tuples directly, this method will break.

Behavior:

* Candidate merge if `margin <= distance`

  * `margin == 0` → touching neighbors
  * `margin > 0` → separated by a gap
  * `margin < 0` → overlapping
* **strict=True (default):** merges only **discrete** neighbors within distance; if `margin < 0` (overlap), it *refuses* to merge that pair (starts a new “series”).
* **strict=False:** merges both neighbors **and** overlaps when `margin <= distance` (which is always true for overlaps since margin is negative).

Rule of thumb:

* Use **`merge_overlaps(strict=False)`** to coalesce *contiguous* segments.
* Use **`merge_neighbors(distance=k, strict=True)`** to “bridge small gaps” without accidentally collapsing overlaps.
* Use **`merge_neighbors(..., strict=False)`** if you want a very aggressive “glue everything close together” pass.

---

## B) `merge_*` reducer hooks: `data_reducer` / `data_initializer` (exact semantics + footguns)

### B1) Signatures (3.2.1)

* `merge_overlaps(data_reducer=None, data_initializer=None, strict=True)`
* `merge_neighbors(data_reducer=None, data_initializer=None, distance=1, strict=True)`
* `merge_equals(data_reducer=None, data_initializer=None)` (no `strict`)
  All three advertise “reduce-like” semantics, and in 3.2.1 the implementation indeed mirrors `functools.reduce` behavior.

### B2) What the reducer does

For a run of intervals being merged, the library maintains an accumulator `current_reduced_data` and, for each additional interval, performs:

```
current_reduced_data = data_reducer(current_reduced_data, new_data)
```

If `data_reducer is None`:

* the merged interval’s `.data` is forced to **`None`** (it “annihilates” data because it cannot guess a merge strategy).

### B3) How the initializer works (and when it aliases)

If `data_initializer is None` (default):

* The accumulator starts as **the first interval’s `.data` object**.
* That means the accumulator is **aliased** to an existing interval’s data.

If `data_initializer is not None`:

* The accumulator starts as a **shallow copy** of `data_initializer` (`copy.copy(data_initializer)`).
* Then it immediately reduces the first interval’s data into it.

#### Footgun: `data_initializer` without `data_reducer`

In 3.2.1 source, the initializer path calls `data_reducer(...)` immediately. If you pass `data_initializer` while leaving `data_reducer=None`, you’ll error. Treat it as a contract:

> If you supply `data_initializer`, you must supply `data_reducer`.

### B4) Determinism pitfalls: “equal under comparator” + set iteration

The merge routines sort intervals (`sorted(self.all_intervals)`) and then reduce in that order.

Intervals compare by `(begin, end, data)`; if data are not mutually orderable, comparison falls back to **type name** (so two different payloads of the same unorderable type compare “equal”). In that case:

* the sort’s relative order among “equal” items depends on the **input order**, and `all_intervals` is a **set** → iteration order can vary across runs (hash randomization).
* therefore, **your reduction order can become nondeterministic**, which matters if your reducer is non-commutative (e.g., “pick first,” “append in order,” etc.).

**Mitigation patterns:**

* Make `.data` **orderable** (e.g., tuple `(priority, stable_id, payload)`).
* Or make reducer commutative/associative (e.g., set union).
* Or normalize to a deterministic key before storing (store `data_key` + external lookup table).

### B5) High-leverage reducer recipes (span-mapping friendly)

#### 1) Accumulate annotations as a set (commutative, deterministic)

```python
def add_to_set(acc: set, x):
    acc.add(x)
    return acc

tree.merge_overlaps(
    strict=False,
    data_initializer=set(),
    data_reducer=add_to_set,
)
```

#### 2) Preserve a “best” annotation by priority (order-dependent unless priority total-orders)

```python
def pick_best(acc, x):
    return acc if acc.priority >= x.priority else x

tree.merge_overlaps(strict=False, data_reducer=pick_best)
```

If priorities can tie, include a stable tiebreaker.

#### 3) Merge dictionaries (watch shallow-copy + mutation)

```python
def merge_dict(acc: dict, x: dict):
    acc.update(x)
    return acc

tree.merge_equals(data_initializer={}, data_reducer=merge_dict)
```

If values are nested mutables, shallow copy may not be enough.

---

## C) Span mapping playbook (CodeIntel-ish): coordinates, canonicalization, determinism, caching

### C1) Pick one “primary coordinate axis” per file

**Strong recommendation:** store span bounds as **monotonic integers** per file.

Typical options:

* **UTF-8 byte offsets** (robust, fast, stable for tooling that already works in bytes)
* **Unicode codepoint offsets** (human-aligned but can disagree with external protocols)
* **Protocol-defined units** (e.g., if you’re interoperating with a system that defines offsets in a specific encoding)

Then derive everything else (line/col, UTF-16 positions, etc.) via side tables.

Why:

* All core operations work on comparable bounds; `merge_neighbors()` specifically needs subtraction.

### C2) `(line, col)` vs offsets: what to do

If you truly want `(line, col)`:

* **Do not use `merge_neighbors`** unless you wrap positions in a custom numeric type that supports subtraction.
* Safer: convert `(line,col)` ↔ offset using a newline index:

  * `line_starts = [0, ...]`
  * `offset = line_starts[line] + col`
  * Then store offsets in IntervalTree.

### C3) Data modeling for span mapping

Your `.data` should be:

* **hashable** (to live in sets and enable deterministic grouping)
* ideally **orderable** (to avoid nondeterministic reductions)
* small (avoid huge payload duplication if you do `split_overlaps()`)

Good pattern:

* `.data = (kind, stable_id, attrs)` where `attrs` is itself hashable (tuple/frozenset) or an interned reference key.

### C4) Canonicalization: `split_overlaps() → merge_neighbors()` (what it does and how to use it)

#### What `split_overlaps()` actually produces

`split_overlaps()` partitions the axis at **every boundary** present in the tree and rewrites intervals so **no interval crosses a boundary**.

Key nuance: it does **not** “union labels”; it **replicates** original interval data across the new atomic segments.

So after splitting, you get a “boundary-aligned segmentation” that is perfect for:

* building *atomic span units*,
* doing deterministic “segment joins,”
* and avoiding partial-overlap logic downstream.

But you may end up with fragmentation (many tiny adjacent segments).

#### Why `merge_neighbors()` after splitting

Once overlaps are eliminated, your fragmentation is typically **adjacent segments** that should be coalesced back into longer runs **when safe**.

However, **`merge_neighbors()` merges regardless of `.data` equality**; it’s purely geometric (+ reducer).

So the correct playbook is:

1. `tree.split_overlaps()`
2. **Group by a “merge key”** (usually the data key you consider equivalent)
3. Within each group, coalesce adjacency using `merge_neighbors(distance=0)` (or small distance if you tolerate gaps)

Concrete pattern:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from intervaltree import IntervalTree

# 1) split
tree.split_overlaps()

# 2) bucket by merge-key (e.g., annotation identity)
buckets = defaultdict(IntervalTree)
for iv in tree:
    key = iv.data  # or normalize(iv.data)
    buckets[key].addi(iv.begin, iv.end, iv.data)

# 3) coalesce adjacency per key
for t in buckets.values():
    t.merge_neighbors(distance=0, strict=True)

# buckets now contains maximal contiguous runs per key
```

Notes:

* Use `distance=0` to merge only touching segments.
* Keep `strict=True` since after splitting you *shouldn’t* have overlaps; if you do, strict prevents accidental collapse and exposes bugs.

#### Alternative (often better): `merge_overlaps(strict=False)` for “touching” coalesce

If your bounds are not numeric (or you want to avoid subtraction), you can do per-key:

* `merge_overlaps(strict=False)` instead of `merge_neighbors(distance=0, ...)`
  because it merges adjacency using comparisons only.

### C5) Deterministic querying and stable outputs

All query results are sets. The README calls out that if ordering matters, **you must sort results**. ([GitHub][1])

For deterministic pipelines:

* Always do `sorted(hits, key=lambda iv: (iv.begin, iv.end, stable_key(iv.data)))`
* Ensure `stable_key` is stable across runs (no object ids, no unordered dict reprs).

### C6) Fast “best containing node” at a point (common in AST/CST mapping)

Pattern:

* `hits = tree.at(pos)`
* choose the **smallest span** (nearest container): `min(hits, key=lambda iv: iv.end - iv.begin)`
  This gives you the “most specific” interval containing the point (useful for “node at cursor”).

### C7) Caching patterns (mutation-safe)

`IntervalTree` is mutable; caching must be invalidated on writes.

A robust pattern:

* Maintain `tree_revision: int`
* Increment on any mutation (add/remove/merge/split/chop/slice)
* Cache key includes revision:

  * `cache[(tree_revision, point)] = sorted_hits`
  * `cache[(tree_revision, begin, end)] = sorted_hits`

If you do many point queries (e.g., cursoring through tokens), even a tiny LRU can pay off.

### C8) Range existence tests without materializing intervals

There’s an `overlaps_range(begin, end)` helper in 3.2.1 that answers “does anything overlap this span?” without returning all hits. Use it when you only need a boolean. (This is especially useful when a downstream pass is expensive.)

---

If you want the *next* increment after this: I can turn the span playbook into **three concrete “indexer-grade” recipes** tailored to your CodeIntel patterns:

1. **Byte-offset span index** for CST/AST nodes (nearest-node + containment queries)
2. **Occurrence span index** for SCIP occurrences (point-to-symbol + range-to-enclosing-def)
3. A deterministic **“segment normalizer”** that outputs canonical, stable, merge-key–coalesced spans suitable for embedding chunk boundaries and stable golden tests.

[1]: https://github.com/chaimleib/intervaltree "GitHub - chaimleib/intervaltree: A mutable, self-balancing interval tree. Queries may be by point, by range overlap, or by range containment."

Below are **three concrete, indexer-grade recipes** you can drop into CodeIntel as “span primitives.” They assume you store **half-open byte spans** `[begin, end)` everywhere, and treat `intervaltree` as an **in-memory accelerator** (build per file on demand / cache), while your canonical truth stays in Arrow/DuckDB.

---

# 1) Byte-offset span index for CST/AST nodes

**Goal:** `nearest-node-at(point)` + `enclosing-node-for(range)` + fast “what nodes overlap this edit span?”

## 1.1 Data model (minimal but sufficient)

Store a **single interval per syntax node**:

* `begin_b: int`, `end_b: int` (byte offsets in file, half-open)
* `node_id: int|str` (stable)
* `kind: str` (e.g., LibCST node type or AST node type)
* `depth: int` (optional but very helpful)
* `parent_id: int|str` (optional)
* `goid: str` (optional, if you already assign GOIDs for defs)

**Payload (`Interval.data`) should be orderable + hashable** for determinism:

```python
# orderable, hashable, cheap
NodeRef = tuple[int, int, str]  # (depth, node_id_int, kind_id_or_name)
```

If `node_id` isn’t an int, map it to a stable int in your node table.

## 1.2 Build pattern (per file)

Inputs: your `syntax_nodes_v1` dataset (Arrow/Polars) already computed from LibCST/ast.

```python
from intervaltree import IntervalTree

def build_syntax_tree(rows) -> IntervalTree:
    t = IntervalTree()
    for r in rows:  # row: (begin_b, end_b, depth, node_id_int, kind)
        b, e = r.begin_b, r.end_b
        if e <= b:  # drop null/degenerate
            continue
        t.addi(b, e, (r.depth, r.node_id_int, r.kind))
    return t
```

**Caching:** cache by `(repo_rev, file_id, syntax_rev)`; rebuild only when the underlying node table changes.

## 1.3 Query recipes

### A) Nearest node at a cursor point

Heuristic that works extremely well in practice: **smallest span wins**, then **deepest** (or vice versa; pick one and be consistent).

```python
def nearest_node_at(t: IntervalTree, pos_b: int):
    hits = t.at(pos_b)
    if not hits:
        return None
    # choose smallest interval; tie-break by greatest depth
    best = min(hits, key=lambda iv: ((iv.end - iv.begin), -iv.data[0], iv.data[1]))
    return best.data  # (depth, node_id, kind)
```

### B) Enclosing node for a selection range

Use `envelop(begin,end)` to get nodes fully containing the selection; choose the tightest.

```python
def enclosing_node_for(t: IntervalTree, begin_b: int, end_b: int):
    hits = t.envelop(begin_b, end_b)
    if not hits:
        return None
    best = min(hits, key=lambda iv: ((iv.end - iv.begin), -iv.data[0], iv.data[1]))
    return best.data
```

### C) Nodes overlapping an edit span (incremental invalidation)

```python
def overlapping_nodes(t, begin_b, end_b):
    # overlap returns nodes that intersect the edit span (useful for “what got touched?”)
    return sorted(t.overlap(begin_b, end_b), key=lambda iv: (iv.begin, iv.end, iv.data))
```

## 1.4 “Indexer-grade” refinements

* **Kind filtering:** maintain a set of “structural kinds” (FunctionDef/ClassDef/Call/Attribute/Name) and filter hits before selecting best.
* **Two-tier trees:** build one tree for “all nodes” and one for “def nodes” (defs only). Def-tree gives more stable UX for “jump to enclosing def.”
* **Edit locality:** if you’re doing LSP-like operations, keep a rolling cache of `pos_b → nearest_node` for the last N cursor positions; invalidate cache when file revision increments.

---

# 2) Occurrence span index for SCIP occurrences

**Goal:** `point → (symbol, role)` resolution, plus `range → enclosing def symbol` and “best symbol under cursor” with sane precedence.

## 2.1 Inputs you should expose (per file)

From your `scip_occurrences_v1` table (per document/file), you want at least:

* `begin_b`, `end_b`
* `symbol: str`
* `role: int|enum` (definition/reference/import/etc)
* `syntax_id` (optional crosswalk to your syntax node id)
* `enclosing_symbol` (optional, if you precompute)

### Payload design

Make it deterministic and sortable by precedence:

```python
OccRef = tuple[int, str]  # (role_rank, symbol)
```

Where `role_rank` is a **small int** computed from SCIP roles.

Example precedence (tune to taste):

* 0: definition
* 1: import/namespace/module ref
* 2: type ref
* 3: value ref
* 4: any

## 2.2 Build: one tree for all occurrences, plus a def-tree

```python
def build_occurrence_trees(occ_rows):
    occ_t = IntervalTree()
    def_t = IntervalTree()
    for r in occ_rows:  # (begin_b, end_b, symbol, role_rank, is_definition)
        if r.end_b <= r.begin_b:
            continue
        payload = (r.role_rank, r.symbol)
        occ_t.addi(r.begin_b, r.end_b, payload)
        if r.is_definition:
            def_t.addi(r.begin_b, r.end_b, payload)
    return occ_t, def_t
```

## 2.3 Point → best symbol under cursor

You typically want:

1. smallest span (token-level beats big span),
2. best role rank (definition > reference),
3. stable symbol tie-break.

```python
def best_symbol_at(occ_t: IntervalTree, pos_b: int):
    hits = occ_t.at(pos_b)
    if not hits:
        return None
    best = min(
        hits,
        key=lambda iv: (
            (iv.end - iv.begin),      # smallest token span
            iv.data[0],               # best role_rank
            iv.data[1],               # stable symbol
        ),
    )
    role_rank, symbol = best.data
    return role_rank, symbol
```

## 2.4 Range → enclosing definition (best-effort)

If you have an occurrence at `pos_b` (reference), find the tightest definition interval that **envelops** it. This gives you “enclosing def” *within the same file*.

```python
def enclosing_def_at(def_t: IntervalTree, begin_b: int, end_b: int):
    hits = def_t.envelop(begin_b, end_b)
    if not hits:
        return None
    best = min(hits, key=lambda iv: ((iv.end - iv.begin), iv.data[1]))
    return best.data  # (role_rank, symbol)
```

### Cross-file “go to definition”

Do *not* try to do that with intervaltree alone. Use:

* `symbol → (def_doc_id, def_begin_b, def_end_b)` map precomputed from SCIP (or derived from your `goid_crosswalk` tables),
  then:
* on navigation, load/build the destination file’s syntax/def trees lazily and return the node.

## 2.5 Indexer-grade refinements

* **Multi-hit UX:** return the full sorted hit list for ambiguous points (e.g., `Name` that is both a type and a value). Provide a deterministic ordering to clients.
* **Role bucketing:** maintain separate trees for `definitions`, `references`, `imports` if you frequently query by category; this avoids scanning a mixed hit set.
* **Stable tests:** emit a canonical “symbol-under-cursor” snapshot fixture using a fixed list of cursor points and compare `(symbol, role_rank)` results.

---

# 3) Deterministic segment normalizer

**Goal:** Take messy, overlapping spans (e.g., tags/labels/features) and produce a **canonical, disjoint segmentation** with **stable merge-key coalescing**—ideal for:

* embedding chunk boundaries,
* stable golden tests,
* consistent downstream joins.

This recipe is the workhorse for “span mapping at scale.”

## 3.1 The problem you’re actually solving

Inputs often contain:

* overlaps (multiple labels cover the same bytes),
* adjacency fragmentation,
* nondeterministic ordering if payload isn’t orderable.

You want output that is:

* **disjoint** (no overlaps),
* **maximally merged** for identical label-sets,
* deterministic across runs.

## 3.2 Output contract (recommended)

Emit segments as:

* `begin_b`, `end_b`
* `labels: tuple[LabelKey, ...]` sorted
* `labels_hash: str|int` (optional; stable fingerprint)
* `primary_label: LabelKey` (optional; if you need a single owner)

Where `LabelKey` is a stable, orderable tuple like:

```python
LabelKey = tuple[str, str]  # (kind, stable_id) e.g. ("goid", "F:pkg.mod.func#1")
```

## 3.3 Normalization pipeline (deterministic, overlap-safe)

### Step 0: Load intervals with *single-label* payloads

```python
def build_label_tree(spans) -> IntervalTree:
    t = IntervalTree()
    for s in spans:  # (begin_b, end_b, label_key)
        if s.end_b <= s.begin_b:
            continue
        # store as a 1-label tuple to keep payload orderable
        t.addi(s.begin_b, s.end_b, (s.label_key,))
    return t
```

### Step 1: Split on all boundaries (atomic segmentation)

This produces atomic segments, but you may now have *multiple intervals with identical (begin,end)* differing only by label.

```python
t.split_overlaps()
```

### Step 2: Collapse identical ranges by unioning labels (`merge_equals`)

After splitting, all overlaps are boundary-aligned, so you can safely combine same-range intervals:

```python
def union_labels(acc: tuple, x: tuple):
    # both are tuples of LabelKey; produce a sorted, deduped tuple
    out = set(acc)
    out.update(x)
    return tuple(sorted(out))

t.merge_equals(data_reducer=union_labels)
```

Now each `[begin,end)` appears at most once, with `data = (label_key_1, label_key_2, ...)`.

### Step 3: Coalesce adjacent segments with identical label sets

Adjacent means `[a,b)` then `[b,c)`.

You must merge *only when label sets are equal*. The safest way is bucket-by-data:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def coalesce_adjacent_by_labels(t: IntervalTree) -> IntervalTree:
    buckets = defaultdict(IntervalTree)
    for iv in t:
        buckets[iv.data].addi(iv.begin, iv.end, iv.data)
    out = IntervalTree()
    for labels, bt in buckets.items():
        bt.merge_overlaps(strict=False)  # strict=False merges touching neighbors
        out |= bt
    return out
```

### Step 4: Canonical ordering for stable output

Always sort output segments explicitly:

```python
segments = sorted(out, key=lambda iv: (iv.begin, iv.end, iv.data))
```

## 3.4 Optional: pick a single “primary” label (stable)

If a downstream consumer needs one owner (e.g., “which function owns this byte range?”), apply a deterministic priority:

```python
KIND_PRIORITY = {"goid": 0, "symbol": 1, "subsystem": 2}

def pick_primary(labels: tuple[LabelKey, ...]) -> LabelKey:
    return min(labels, key=lambda k: (KIND_PRIORITY.get(k[0], 99), k[1]))
```

## 3.5 Embedding chunk boundary recipe (practical)

Once you have canonical segments:

* Group contiguous segments by `primary_label` (or by exact label-set if you want “multi-owner” chunks).
* Accumulate until you hit a max byte budget (e.g., 8–32KB) or semantic boundary (new function/class).
* Emit chunk spans as unions of segments (still half-open, still deterministic).

This gives you **stable chunking** across runs and small edits, which is exactly what you want for golden tests and embedding refresh minimization.

## 3.6 Test harness hook (golden-friendly)

Create a fixture per file:

* input spans (unordered)
* normalized segments (ordered)
* assert exact equality

If you also persist `labels_hash`, you can snapshot only `(begin,end,hash)` to reduce fixture size.

---

## How these three recipes compose (the CodeIntel “span stack”)

* **SyntaxTree**: “what syntax node is here / contains this”
* **OccTree (+ DefTree)**: “what SCIP symbol is here / enclosing def”
* **SegmentNormalizer**: “what’s the canonical segmentation of labels across bytes”

A very strong practical flow is:

1. use **OccTree** to resolve symbol(s) at cursor,
2. use **SyntaxTree** to pick the best syntactic container (def/class/call),
3. use **SegmentNormalizer** to build stable chunks for embeddings or summaries.

If you want, I can translate these into **repo-aligned artifacts**: proposed dataset contract schemas (`spans.syntax_nodes_v1`, `spans.scip_occurrences_v1`, `spans.normalized_segments_v1`), and Hamilton node boundaries (e.g., `t__spans__syntax_tree_cache`, `t__spans__occ_tree_cache`, `t__spans__segments_normalize`) that fit your existing “targets from DAG tags” convention.

Below is a **repo-aligned translation** of the three span recipes into:

1. **Dataset contract schemas** (Arrow-first, DuckDB-friendly) for

   * `spans.syntax_nodes_v1`
   * `spans.scip_occurrences_v1`
   * `spans.normalized_segments_v1`

2. **Hamilton node boundaries** (compute nodes + `t__` materializers + cache artifacts) that fit your “**targets from DAG tags**” convention.

I’m assuming your canonical identity columns already exist (or you’re moving toward them): `run_id`, `repo_id`, `file_id` (+ `rel_path` in a core files table). If your current repo uses different names, treat these as **aliases** and keep the *shape*.

---

# 0) Conventions (make span primitives composable)

## Coordinate system

* All spans are **byte offsets** into the file’s **raw bytes** with **half-open** semantics: `[begin_b, end_b)`.
* Invariants you enforce everywhere:

  * `0 <= begin_b < end_b`
  * spans are measured against the exact bytes that were parsed / indexed (no newline normalization drift).

## Determinism policy

* Any “set-like” collection stored in a cell must have a **canonical order** (sorted).
* Any “reduce/merge” must be stable under:

  * different ingestion ordering,
  * hash randomization,
  * parallel extraction.

## Partitioning / physical ordering

DuckDB doesn’t rely heavily on indexes; you get most wins from **sort order** + partition keys:

* Always materialize these tables ordered by:
  `repo_id, file_id, begin_b, end_b` (or `repo_id, rel_path, begin_b, end_b` if that’s your join key).

---

# 1) Dataset contract: `spans.syntax_nodes_v1`

### Purpose

A minimal, query-optimized projection of your CST/AST node table with **stable ids** and **byte spans** suitable for:

* nearest-node-at-point
* enclosing-node-for-range
* overlap queries for edits

### Primary key

* `(run_id, file_id, node_id)`

### Required columns (Arrow types)

* `run_id: large_string` (or `fixed_size_binary(16)` if you use UUID bytes)
* `repo_id: large_string` (or same as above)
* `file_id: large_string` (stable internal id; don’t use path as PK)
* `node_id: int64` (stable per file per run; deterministic numbering is ideal)
* `parent_node_id: int64?` (nullable; root nodes null)
* `kind: large_string` (LibCST node type / AST node type / normalized kind)
* `depth: int32` (root=0; deterministic; makes “nearest” selection faster)
* `begin_b: int64`
* `end_b: int64`

### Recommended optional columns (high-leverage)

* `is_def: bool` (true for def-like nodes: function/class/assignment target/etc.)
* `name: large_string?` (only when cheap; otherwise keep in a side table)
* `goid: large_string?` (your internal stable symbol/GOID, if already computed)
* `span_hash: uint64` (stable hash of `(begin_b,end_b,kind,node_id)` for drift tests)

### Contract invariants

* `end_b > begin_b`
* `(file_id,node_id)` unique within `(run_id,repo_id)`
* `depth` consistent with `parent_node_id` (child depth = parent depth + 1) **if** you populate parents
* You may have overlaps (AST/CST nesting), that’s expected.

### Physical layout / sort keys

* Sort: `repo_id, file_id, begin_b, end_b, depth`
* If you persist as Parquet/Iceberg: partition by `repo_id` (and optionally `file_id` if very large repos)

---

# 2) Dataset contract: `spans.scip_occurrences_v1`

### Purpose

A span-indexable, deterministic view of SCIP occurrences suitable for:

* point → best symbol (role precedence)
* range → enclosing definition (in-file)
* overlap queries for edits

### Primary key

* `(run_id, file_id, occ_id)`
  Where `occ_id` is a stable integer within the file (deterministic sort-based numbering).

### Required columns (Arrow types)

* `run_id: large_string`
* `repo_id: large_string`
* `file_id: large_string`
* `occ_id: int64`
* `begin_b: int64`
* `end_b: int64`
* `symbol: large_string`
* `role_flags: int64` (raw SCIP bitmask)
* `role_rank: int16` (derived precedence rank for cursor resolution)
* `is_definition: bool`

### Recommended optional columns

* `syntax_node_id: int64?` (nullable; crosswalk to `spans.syntax_nodes_v1.node_id` when available)
* `enclosing_def_symbol: large_string?` (nullable; fast path for “enclosing def” UX)
* `symbol_hash: uint64` (stable hash of symbol string for joins / compactness)
* `diagnostics: large_string?` (only if you carry SCIP ingestion errors)

### Contract invariants

* `end_b > begin_b`
* `role_rank` is fully deterministic from `role_flags` (same mapping across runs)
* `(file_id, occ_id)` unique within `(run_id,repo_id)`
* If you populate `syntax_node_id`, it must reference a real node in the same `(run_id,file_id)`

### Physical layout / sort keys

* Sort: `repo_id, file_id, begin_b, end_b, role_rank, symbol`

---

# 3) Dataset contract: `spans.normalized_segments_v1`

### Purpose

A canonical, **disjoint** segmentation of file bytes into maximal runs with a stable **label-set**. This is the table that makes:

* embedding chunk boundaries stable
* golden tests robust
* downstream joins deterministic

### Primary key

* `(run_id, file_id, segment_id)`
  Where `segment_id` is deterministic from ordering (row_number over `begin_b`).

### Required columns (Arrow types)

* `run_id: large_string`
* `repo_id: large_string`
* `file_id: large_string`
* `segment_id: int64`
* `begin_b: int64`
* `end_b: int64`

**Label set (choose one encoding; pick based on ergonomics):**

**Option A (simplest / fast):**

* `labels: list<large_string>` where each element is canonical `"kind:id"`
  Example: `"goid:F:pkg.mod.func#1"`, `"symbol:scip-python ..."`.
* `labels_hash: uint64` (hash of the ordered labels list; stable)

**Option B (more structured):**

* `labels: list<struct<kind: large_string, id: large_string>>`
* `labels_hash: uint64`

And for “single-owner” consumers:

* `primary_label: large_string` (canonical `"kind:id"`)
* `label_count: int16`

### Contract invariants (critical)

Per `(run_id,file_id)`:

* Segments are **disjoint** and ordered:

  * `begin_b` strictly increasing
  * `end_b > begin_b`
  * **no overlaps**
* Maximal merge property:

  * if two adjacent segments touch (`a.end_b == b.begin_b`) then `a.labels != b.labels`
* `labels` are:

  * deduped
  * sorted canonically
* `labels_hash` is stable and equals hash(canonical labels)

### Physical layout / sort keys

* Sort: `repo_id, file_id, begin_b`
* Partition: `repo_id` (and optionally file_id for huge repos)

# 4) Hamilton node boundaries (repo-aligned, “targets from DAG tags”)

You want three things in the DAG:

1. compute projections (`spans__*`)
2. deterministic normalization (`spans__segments_normalize`)
3. optional caches (interval trees) as artifacts (`spans__*_tree_cache`) with `t__` anchors

## 4.1 Suggested module layout

```
src/codeintel/build/hamilton/native/spans/
  __init__.py
  syntax_nodes.py
  scip_occurrences.py
  segments_normalize.py
  tree_cache.py
```

Rationale:

* keeps span primitives isolated
* makes it trivial to feature-flag caches and normalization

## 4.2 Node naming convention

* Compute nodes: `spans__<thing>_<vN>()`
* Materializers: `t__spans__<target>()` (your “target spec anchor”)
* Cache artifacts: `spans__<tree>_cache()` + `t__spans__<tree>_cache()` anchor

## 4.3 Node graph (high level)

### (A) Syntax nodes projection

* **Input (existing):** `syntax.nodes_v1` (or your current CST/AST node table)
* **Compute:** `spans__syntax_nodes_v1(syntax_nodes_v1, core_files_v1, span_config) -> ArrowTable`
* **Anchor/materialize:** `t__spans__syntax_nodes_v1(spans__syntax_nodes_v1) -> DatasetRef`

### (B) SCIP occurrences projection

* **Input (existing):** `scip.occurrences_v1` (raw ingested occurrences)
* **Compute:** `spans__scip_occurrences_v1(scip_occurrences_v1, core_files_v1, role_rank_policy) -> ArrowTable`
* **Anchor/materialize:** `t__spans__scip_occurrences_v1(...) -> DatasetRef`

### (C) Normalized segments

* **Inputs:** `spans.syntax_nodes_v1`, `spans.scip_occurrences_v1`, `span_label_policy`
* **Compute:** `spans__segments_normalize(spans__syntax_nodes_v1, spans__scip_occurrences_v1, span_label_policy) -> ArrowTable`
* **Anchor/materialize:** `t__spans__normalized_segments_v1(spans__segments_normalize) -> DatasetRef`

### (D) Optional caches (artifact targets)

* **Compute:** `spans__syntax_tree_cache(spans__syntax_nodes_v1, cache_config) -> ArrowTable (metadata) OR ArtifactMap`
* **Anchor/materialize:** `t__spans__syntax_tree_cache(...) -> ArtifactRef/DatasetRef`
* Similarly for occurrences:

  * `spans__occ_tree_cache(spans__scip_occurrences_v1, cache_config)`

---

# 5) Concrete node boundary specs (signatures + responsibilities)

Below I’m describing each node as a “contract” you can implement in your existing Hamilton + gateway patterns.

## 5.1 `spans__syntax_nodes_v1`

**Inputs**

* `syntax_nodes_v1`: Arrow/Polars table from parsing (canonical)
* `core_files_v1`: file identity + raw bytes length (optional but recommended for validation)
* `span_config`: policy object (e.g., include_parent_links, include_depth, include_goid)

**Responsibilities**

* Ensure `begin_b/end_b` exist and are bytes, not (line,col).
* Enforce invariants (drop or flag `end_b <= begin_b`).
* Compute `depth` deterministically if not provided (optional, but a big win).
* Emit only the columns in `spans.syntax_nodes_v1` contract.

**Output**

* Arrow Table matching `spans.syntax_nodes_v1`.

**t__ anchor**: `t__spans__syntax_nodes_v1`

* Tagged as `node_type="materialize"`, `target="spans.syntax_nodes_v1"`
* Calls your Arrow materializer (to Parquet/Iceberg/DuckDB depending on your stack).

---

## 5.2 `spans__scip_occurrences_v1`

**Inputs**

* `scip_occurrences_v1`: raw occurrences (may be SCIP-native range encoding)
* `core_files_v1`: for validation + mapping if you need doc_id → file_id
* `role_rank_policy`: mapping from SCIP role bitmask → `role_rank` + `is_definition`

**Responsibilities**

* Normalize ranges to `begin_b/end_b` bytes.
* Derive:

  * `role_rank` (stable)
  * `is_definition`
* Assign deterministic `occ_id`:

  * `occ_id = row_number() over (partition by file_id order by begin_b, end_b, role_rank, symbol)`
* Optionally attach `syntax_node_id` via an xref step (if you have it); otherwise keep nullable.

**Output**

* Arrow Table matching `spans.scip_occurrences_v1`.

**t__ anchor**: `t__spans__scip_occurrences_v1`

* Tagged target materialization.

---

## 5.3 `spans__segments_normalize`

**Inputs**

* `spans__syntax_nodes_v1`
* `spans__scip_occurrences_v1`
* `span_label_policy` (what label kinds to include + precedence)

**Responsibilities**

* Convert chosen inputs to canonical **label spans**:

  * from syntax nodes: `("goid", goid)` or `("node", node_id)` (policy)
  * from scip occurrences: `("symbol", symbol)` or `("symbol_hash", hash)` (policy)
* Run normalization pipeline:

  1. build intervaltree with single-label payloads
  2. `split_overlaps()`
  3. `merge_equals()` with union reducer (canonical sorted set)
  4. coalesce adjacency **per label-set**
* Emit disjoint segments with canonical `labels` list and `labels_hash`.
* Assign deterministic `segment_id` via ordering.

**Output**

* Arrow Table matching `spans.normalized_segments_v1`.

**t__ anchor**: `t__spans__normalized_segments_v1`

---

# 6) Cache targets (interval trees) as repo-aligned artifacts

You have two practical implementation choices. I’d pick **Option A** first; it plays nicest with your “targets from DAG tags” system.

## Option A: “Cache metadata table + files on disk” (recommended)

### Artifact layout

* Store pickled trees under a cache root:

  * `{cache_root}/{repo_id}/{run_id}/spans/syntax_tree/{file_id}.pkl`
  * `{cache_root}/{repo_id}/{run_id}/spans/occ_tree/{file_id}.pkl` (contains both occ + def trees)

### Hamilton outputs

* `spans__syntax_tree_cache(...) -> spans.syntax_tree_cache_v1` (metadata table)
* `spans__occ_tree_cache(...) -> spans.occ_tree_cache_v1` (metadata table)

Each metadata row:

* `run_id, repo_id, file_id`
* `cache_kind: large_string` (“syntax_tree”, “occ_tree”)
* `path: large_string`
* `sha256: fixed_size_binary(32)` (or large_string hex)
* `bytes_len: int64`
* `build_rev: int64` (monotonic; for invalidation)

This makes caches:

* reproducible,
* testable,
* and pluggable into your gateway/materialization system.

**t__ anchors**

* `t__spans__syntax_tree_cache`
* `t__spans__occ_tree_cache`

## Option B: Store blobs directly in DuckDB/Parquet

Feasible, but tends to be awkward and less portable. Only do this if your environment forbids filesystem caches.

---

# 7) “Targets from DAG tags” metadata (how to keep it aligned)

For each `t__` node, your docstring becomes the canonical target documentation. Keep it mechanically parseable.

Example docstring template (apply to each `t__spans__*`):

* What it materializes (`spans.*_v1`)
* Key invariants (half-open, determinism)
* Sort keys / partitioning guidance
* Upstream deps (syntax/scip versions)
* Version bump rules (what constitutes v2)

Tag payload shape (conceptual; adapt to your existing decorator wrapper):

* `domain="spans"`
* `target="spans.syntax_nodes_v1"`
* `node_type="materialize"`
* `contract="spans.syntax_nodes_v1"` (if you keep contract registry by name)

---

# 8) Minimal “definition of done” per artifact (so this ships cleanly)

## spans.syntax_nodes_v1

* [ ] Byte offsets validated against file length (at least `end_b <= file_nbytes`)
* [ ] Deterministic `node_id` and/or stable mapping strategy documented
* [ ] Sorted materialization

## spans.scip_occurrences_v1

* [ ] Deterministic `occ_id`
* [ ] Stable `role_rank` mapping covered by tests
* [ ] Sorted materialization

## spans.normalized_segments_v1

* [ ] Disjointness + maximal merge invariants asserted (per file)
* [ ] Canonical label sorting enforced
* [ ] Stable `labels_hash` tested

## tree caches (optional)

* [ ] Cache invalidation keyed by upstream dataset revision/hash
* [ ] Metadata table exists and is stable for golden tests

---

If you want the **next increment**, I can write this as a **repo-ready contract pack**:

* the three `pyarrow.schema(...)` objects (and matching DuckDB DDL if you want it),
* plus the Hamilton node skeletons (function signatures + tags + t__ anchors),
* and a tiny pytest “contract harness” that asserts:

  * span invariants,
  * determinism under shuffled input ordering,
  * and normalized-segment disjointness/maximality.

Below is a **repo-ready contract pack** you can paste in as-is (modulo minor import-path tweaks to match your repo). It includes:

* **3× `pyarrow.schema(...)`** objects
* **Matching DuckDB DDL** strings
* **Hamilton node skeletons** (compute nodes + `t__` anchors with tags)
* **Pytest contract harness** asserting:

  * span invariants,
  * determinism under shuffled input ordering,
  * normalized-segment disjointness + maximality

## Notes you can apply immediately (zero design churn)

* **Delimiter:** this pack uses `kind|id` because SCIP symbols often contain `:`; you avoid parsing ambiguity.
* **Normalized segments omit unlabeled gaps** by design. If you want full file coverage (including empty-label segments), you can add a post-pass that fills gaps using file length (from `core_files_v1`) and `labels=[]`.
* The normalization algorithm is intentionally **commutative** (union + sorted) so it stays deterministic even if intervaltree internal ordering changes.

---

If you want the *next* increment after this pack: I can extend the harness into a **golden “span-normalizer fixture suite”** that:

* runs on a tiny real repo sample,
* produces stable snapshot files under `tests/golden/spans/...`,
* and includes regression tests for “small edit” scenarios (insert/delete ranges) to ensure your span indices behave correctly under incremental updates.

Below is a **golden “span-normalizer fixture suite”** that is repo-ready and does exactly what you asked:

* runs on a **tiny real repo sample** (checked into `tests/fixtures/spans_tiny_repo/`)
* **writes/compares stable snapshots** under `tests/golden/spans/spans_tiny_repo/...`
* includes **edit regressions** (insert/delete) that validate your span indices behave correctly under incremental changes

---

## 1) Tiny real repo sample (fixture)

### `tests/fixtures/spans_tiny_repo/tiny_pkg/__init__.py`

```python
"""Tiny fixture package for span-normalizer golden tests."""
```

### `tests/fixtures/spans_tiny_repo/tiny_pkg/alpha.py`

```python
def outer(x):
    def inner(y):
        return x + y
    return inner(1)

class Greeter:
    def greet(self, name):
        return f"hi {name}"
```

### `tests/fixtures/spans_tiny_repo/tiny_pkg/beta.py`

```python
from .alpha import outer, Greeter

async def arun():
    return outer(2)(3)

def run():
    g = Greeter()
    return outer(2)(3), g.greet("you")
```

---

## 2) Golden snapshots folder + workflow note

### `tests/golden/spans/spans_tiny_repo/README.md`

```md
# span-normalizer goldens (spans_tiny_repo)

This folder contains golden snapshots produced by `test_span_normalizer_golden.py`.

## Update goldens

Run:

    CODEINTEL_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 pytest -k span_normalizer_golden -q

This will rewrite `*.segments.json` files under this directory.

## What’s in the snapshots?

Per-file canonical segments:
- begin_b/end_b (byte offsets, half-open)
- labels (sorted, deduped)
- labels_hash (stable)
- primary_label (stable priority choice)
```

---

## 3) Golden test suite + edit regressions

## What you get from this suite

* A **real-file** fixture (not synthetic spans) that still keeps extraction minimal and deterministic.
* Goldens that stabilize your normalization output **per-file** under `tests/golden/spans/spans_tiny_repo/...`.
* Three regression patterns:

  1. **prefix insert** (global shift)
  2. **insert+delete in a known “gap boundary”** (pure shift for downstream segments + roundtrip equality)
  3. **insert inside a labeled region** (label-universe preservation + invariants)

If you want the next increment after *this*: I can adapt the fixture extractor to optionally call your **actual** CodeIntel ingestion path (SCIP decode + LibCST spans) when an env var is set, so the same golden suite can run in **two modes**:

* fast AST-based “unit-ish” mode (always-on CI),
* full pipeline “integration” mode (nightly / pre-release).

Below is a **repo-ready “two-mode” golden suite** upgrade that keeps *one* test file but lets you flip between:

* **unit mode (default):** fast AST-based extractor (always-on CI)
* **integration mode:** calls your **real CodeIntel ingestion path** (SCIP decode + LibCST spans) via a pluggable adapter, intended for nightly / pre-release

It also **separates goldens by mode** so integration outputs don’t fight unit outputs.

---

# 1) Updated golden layout + workflow

## `tests/golden/spans/spans_tiny_repo/README.md` (replace/update)

```md
# span-normalizer goldens (spans_tiny_repo)

This suite runs in two modes:

## Mode A: unit (default, fast)
- Extracts spans from Python `ast` only (defs/classes) and synthetic “SCIP-like” def occurrences.
- Goldens live under: `tests/golden/spans/spans_tiny_repo/unit/`

Run:
  pytest -k span_normalizer_golden -q

Update goldens:
  CODEINTEL_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 pytest -k span_normalizer_golden -q

## Mode B: integration (real pipeline)
- Calls your actual CodeIntel ingestion path (LibCST spans + SCIP decode).
- Goldens live under: `tests/golden/spans/spans_tiny_repo/integration/`

Run:
  CODEINTEL_SPANS_MODE=integration CODEINTEL_SPANS_ADAPTER=codeintel.testing.spans_integration_adapter:build_inputs \
  pytest -k span_normalizer_golden -q

Update goldens:
  CODEINTEL_SPANS_MODE=integration CODEINTEL_SPANS_ADAPTER=codeintel.testing.spans_integration_adapter:build_inputs \
  CODEINTEL_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1 pytest -k span_normalizer_golden -q

### Env vars
- `CODEINTEL_SPANS_MODE`: `unit` (default) or `integration`
- `CODEINTEL_SPANS_ADAPTER`: `module:function` returning `(syntax_nodes_table, scip_occurrences_table)`
- `CODEINTEL_UPDATE_GOLDENS=1`: rewrite snapshot files
```

---

# 2) Integration adapter hook (pluggable, repo-stable)

Create this **adapter stub** under `src/` so it’s importable without making `tests/` a package.

## `src/codeintel/testing/spans_integration_adapter.py` (new)

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Tuple

import pyarrow as pa


def build_inputs(repo_root: Path, run_id: str, repo_id: str) -> tuple[pa.Table, pa.Table]:
    """
    Integration-mode adapter for golden span tests.

    Contract:
      Return (syntax_nodes_input, scip_occurrences_input) as PyArrow Tables.

    Required columns for syntax_nodes_input (minimum):
      - file_id (string): use repo-relative path or your canonical file_id
      - node_id (int64): stable per file
      - parent_node_id (int64, nullable) OR omit (projection will fill nulls if column exists)
      - kind (string)
      - depth (int32)
      - begin_b (int64)
      - end_b (int64)
      - goid (string, nullable)   [recommended if you want "goid" labels]
      - is_def (bool, nullable)   [optional]

    Required columns for scip_occurrences_input (minimum):
      - file_id (string)
      - begin_b (int64)
      - end_b (int64)
      - symbol (string)
      - role_flags (int64)
      - role_rank (int16)         [stable mapping]
      - is_definition (bool)

    Notes:
    - You may return your *raw* CodeIntel ingestion tables (e.g. syntax.nodes_v1 + scip.occurrences_v1)
      as long as they already include the required columns above (or you map/rename here).
    - This function is intentionally the only integration coupling point; the golden suite remains unchanged.

    Implementation options (choose one):
      A) Call your Hamilton driver directly for the fixture repo_root, requesting the needed upstream tables.
      B) Call your CodeIntel CLI/build runner to materialize datasets into a temp workspace, then load as Arrow.
      C) Call your internal ingestion APIs (LibCST span extractor + SCIP decode) and assemble Arrow tables here.

    Recommended: (A) Hamilton driver with minimal DAG targets (syntax + scip) for fixture repo.
    """
    raise NotImplementedError(
        "Implement build_inputs() to call your real CodeIntel ingestion path "
        "(LibCST spans + SCIP decode) and return the two Arrow tables required by the span golden suite."

> In nightly CI you set:
> `CODEINTEL_SPANS_ADAPTER=codeintel.testing.spans_integration_adapter:build_inputs`
> after implementing it.

# 3) Updated golden test module (two modes, same suite)

Replace your existing `tests/golden/spans/test_span_normalizer_golden.py` with this version (it keeps the AST extractor, and adds the integration adapter path + mode-split goldens).

# 4) How you wire “real pipeline” ingestion (what the adapter should do)

In **integration mode**, your adapter should do *exactly one thing*:

> For the fixture repo root, run **LibCST span extraction** and **SCIP decode**, then return two Arrow tables shaped like the inputs expected by `spans__syntax_nodes_v1` and `spans__scip_occurrences_v1`.

Typical practical patterns:

### A) Hamilton-minidag (recommended)

* Build a minimal driver configured to:

  * scan `repo_root` → `core_files_v1`
  * LibCST parse spans → `syntax_nodes_v1`
  * SCIP index/decode → `scip_occurrences_v1`
* Return those two tables (or already-projected `spans.*` inputs if you prefer).

### B) CLI materialize then load

* Run your CodeIntel build CLI in a temp workspace:

  * materialize `syntax.nodes_v1` and `scip.occurrences_v1` (or directly your `spans.*` tables)
* Load as Arrow and return.

Either way, the golden suite stays unchanged; only `build_inputs()` is the integration seam.

---

If you want one more increment after this: I can provide a **concrete adapter implementation template** for the Hamilton-minidag approach that mirrors your “targets from DAG tags” pattern (driver construction + target execution + Arrow table extraction), written so you only need to fill in *your* actual driver/build entrypoint and dataset names.

Below is a **concrete integration adapter template** that implements the **Hamilton-minidag approach** in a way that mirrors your **“targets from DAG tags / `t__` anchors”** pattern:

* build a **minimal Hamilton Driver** from a configurable set of native modules,
* execute **exactly two anchor nodes** (or two dataset targets),
* coerce outputs into **PyArrow Tables**,
* return `(syntax_nodes_input, scip_occurrences_input)` for the golden suite.

It’s written so you typically only need to fill:

1. **your module list** (or set it via env var), and
2. **the two upstream dataset targets** (or node names) you want computed.

# ======================================================================================
# CONFIG SURFACE (only knobs you should need to set per-repo)
# ======================================================================================

# 1) Which DAG modules to load for the minidag
#
# Provide as env (recommended for CI):
#   CODEINTEL_SPANS_DAG_MODULES="codeintel.build.hamilton.native.core.files,codeintel.build.hamilton.native.syntax,..."
#
# Or hardcode below.

# 2) Which upstream datasets (targets) to compute
#
# If you follow the naming convention: t__<dataset with '.' -> '__'> (as in this project),
# then setting the DATASET names is enough.
#
# Examples:
#   CODEINTEL_SPANS_SYNTAX_SOURCE_DATASET="syntax.nodes_v1"
#   CODEINTEL_SPANS_SCIP_SOURCE_DATASET="scip.occurrences_v1"

#   CODEINTEL_SPANS_SYNTAX_SOURCE_NODE="t__syntax__nodes_v1"
#   CODEINTEL_SPANS_SCIP_SOURCE_NODE="t__scip__occurrences_v1"
SYNTAX_SOURCE_NODE = os.getenv("CODEINTEL_SPANS_SYNTAX_SOURCE_NODE", "")
SCIP_SOURCE_NODE = os.getenv("CODEINTEL_SPANS_SCIP_SOURCE_NODE", "")

ADAPTER_INPUTS_JSON = os.getenv("CODEINTEL_SPANS_ADAPTER_INPUTS_JSON", "")

      (syntax_nodes_input, scip_occurrences_input)

    You can drive it either by dataset names (preferred) or explicit node names.

    Env knobs:
      - CODEINTEL_SPANS_DAG_MODULES
      - CODEINTEL_SPANS_SYNTAX_SOURCE_DATASET / CODEINTEL_SPANS_SCIP_SOURCE_DATASET
      - CODEINTEL_SPANS_SYNTAX_SOURCE_NODE / CODEINTEL_SPANS_SCIP_SOURCE_NODE
      - CODEINTEL_SPANS_ADAPTER_INPUTS_JSON
      - CODEINTEL_SPANS_DATASET_LOADER (optional, if anchors return refs)
    """
    repo_root = Path(repo_root)

    # modules
    module_csv = os.getenv("CODEINTEL_SPANS_DAG_MODULES", "").strip()
    module_paths = (
        tuple(m.strip() for m in module_csv.split(",") if m.strip())
        if module_csv
        else DEFAULT_DAG_MODULES
    )
    modules = _import_modules(module_paths)

    # driver
    dr = _build_driver(modules)

    # outputs: prefer explicit node overrides, else derive from dataset names
    syntax_node = SYNTAX_SOURCE_NODE.strip() or _dataset_to_anchor_node(SYNTAX_SOURCE_DATASET)
    scip_node = SCIP_SOURCE_NODE.strip() or _dataset_to_anchor_node(SCIP_SOURCE_DATASET)
    outputs = [syntax_node, scip_node]

    # runtime inputs
    inputs = _merge_runtime_inputs(repo_root=repo_root, run_id=run_id, repo_id=repo_id)

    # execute minidag
    # NOTE: Hamilton returns a dict: {output_name: value}
    try:
        results: Mapping[str, Any] = dr.execute(outputs, inputs=inputs)
    except TypeError:
        # Some Hamilton versions call the kwarg "overrides" or omit "inputs".
        # If your Hamilton API differs, adjust only this block.
        results = dr.execute(outputs, **inputs)  # type: ignore[misc]

    if syntax_node not in results or scip_node not in results:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Driver did not return expected outputs: {outputs}. Got: {list(results.keys())}")

    syntax_tbl = _coerce_arrow(results[syntax_node], run_id=run_id, repo_id=repo_id)
    scip_tbl = _coerce_arrow(results[scip_node], run_id=run_id, repo_id=repo_id)

## How this mirrors your “targets from DAG tags” pattern

* In your convention, a dataset `syntax.nodes_v1` is anchored by `t__syntax__nodes_v1`.
* This adapter defaults to executing those **anchor nodes** derived by:

```python
t__ + dataset.replace(".", "__")
```

So you can configure integration mode purely with dataset names:

```bash
CODEINTEL_SPANS_MODE=integration \
CODEINTEL_SPANS_DAG_MODULES="...your minimal modules..." \
CODEINTEL_SPANS_SYNTAX_SOURCE_DATASET="syntax.nodes_v1" \
CODEINTEL_SPANS_SCIP_SOURCE_DATASET="scip.occurrences_v1" \
pytest -k span_normalizer_golden -q
```

If your repo deviates from that anchor naming, set the explicit node env vars instead:

```bash
CODEINTEL_SPANS_SYNTAX_SOURCE_NODE="t__syntax__nodes_v1_realname" \
CODEINTEL_SPANS_SCIP_SOURCE_NODE="t__scip__occurrences_v1_realname"
```

---

## If your `t__` anchors return DatasetRefs (materialize-first)

If your anchor nodes *materialize* and return something like `DatasetRef` (not an Arrow table), set a loader hook:

1. Implement a loader callable somewhere stable, e.g.:

```python
# src/codeintel/storage/testing_loaders.py
import pyarrow as pa

def load_arrow_for_test(ref_or_name, *, run_id: str, repo_id: str) -> pa.Table:
    # ref_or_name might be DatasetRef or a dataset string
    # Use your storage gateway to load as Arrow.
    # return gateway.load_arrow(...)
    raise NotImplementedError
```

2. Then run integration mode with:

```bash
CODEINTEL_SPANS_DATASET_LOADER="codeintel.storage.testing_loaders:load_arrow_for_test"
```

This keeps the adapter faithful to: **“execute `t__` → materialize → load Arrow”**.

## What you (typically) need to fill in

1. **`CODEINTEL_SPANS_DAG_MODULES`**: the smallest module set that can produce:

   * `t__syntax__nodes_v1` (LibCST spans path)
   * `t__scip__occurrences_v1` (SCIP decode path)

2. If needed, **dataset/node names**:

   * `CODEINTEL_SPANS_SYNTAX_SOURCE_DATASET`
   * `CODEINTEL_SPANS_SCIP_SOURCE_DATASET`
   * or explicit `*_SOURCE_NODE`

3. If anchors return refs, wire **`CODEINTEL_SPANS_DATASET_LOADER`**.

---

If you want the next increment: tell me the *actual* anchor node names (or dataset targets) you use for “LibCST nodes table” and “SCIP occurrences table”, and the Hamilton-native module package root you’re using. I can then rewrite the defaults in this adapter to match your repo’s exact module paths + provide the minimal `CODEINTEL_SPANS_DAG_MODULES` set (so you don’t have to guess which modules are required).
